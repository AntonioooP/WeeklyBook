# WeeklyBook
The purpose of this project is a website in the style of Instagram/Reddit for viewing a series of posts about different books (these posts are added weekly, hence the name), each post has an image, which is a fun infographic about what the book is about, to present a book simply and engagingly.

The project has two folders:
### Frontend
- Made with vite + jsx

### Backend
- Made with Express js
